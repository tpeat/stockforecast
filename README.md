# Stock Forecaster

Goal is to create a forecaster that predicts stock opening day prices based on past data.

### Stock Scraper

```
Meant to pull data from Nasdaq. Currently having issues with the visibility of data on their site. 
Might just download it regularly

```
### Yahoo Finance Library
```
Might just pull their historic data from this library. Seems legit. 
Going to make a visualizer for it. 
Needs numpy, pandas, matplotlib, yfinance
```

### TODO

* Everything!
* Probably my homework too
