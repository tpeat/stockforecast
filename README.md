# Stock Forecaster

Goal is to create a forecaster that predicts stock opening day prices based on past data.

### Stock Scraper

```
Meant to pull data from Nasdaq. Currently having issues with the visibility of data on their site. 
Might just download it regularly

```
### Reddit instead!
```
We want wallstreet bets. Except finding good posts will be tricky.
```

### Yahoo Finance Library
```
Might just pull their historic data from this library. Seems legit. 
Going to make a visualizer for it. 
Needs numpy, pandas, matplotlib, yfinance
```
### Model
```
Ahh, we will get to this. Data first.
LSTM: long short term memory is pretty good aparently
Also: BERT is a specific type of NLP that does good??

```

### TODO

* Everything!
* Probably my homework too
